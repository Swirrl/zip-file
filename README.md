# zip-file

_ALPHA_

Simple library for working with zip files in clojure. Uses the Java
FileSystem API via [datoteka](https://github.com/funcool/datoteka/) underneath.

NOTE: this library is subject to change, and it's hoped that one day some of 
its features [may be moved into datoteka](https://github.com/funcool/datoteka/issues/7) itself.
